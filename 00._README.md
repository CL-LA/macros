INU SPAMMY VERSION 

*** DO NOT REPLACE/UPDATE ANY FILES IN THIS BRANCH IF YOU ARE NOT SWC INU. 
    INSTEAD UPDATE IN THE MAIN BRANCH. ***

This branch serves as Inu's and her cast of thousands repository for her spammy versions of the macros used across characters.
All characters share these macro files/are dependent on their interconnections.

For example:
The main scanner code is broken out.
The main loop is broken out.
The idle actions are broken out.

All of these have numerous messages sprinkled throughout to track their execution, hence the name SPAMMY.

# macros

abbreviations.macro = a list of replacement macros that make it easier to stay in character without sacrificing playability (aka so you don't fall while trying to type in a lot of text).

inu teisei = A sample character file that sets global variables used in other macros. This makes it easier to manage a cast of thousands (alts) and just adapt other macros by using the global variables in that character's file.

Keys.macro = This key management macro file assumes a cast of thousands (characters), you define a few global variables in your character file (see top of this file for what to copy and paste into your character's file). Then edit the character's file to update the key numbers.
Note to get rid of spam entries for keys you don't have, put // before non-existent keys.
v 20210130 see revision log at end of file. replaces old file. If you made mods to yours, save a copy with another name before replacing it with this one.

layells.macro = clan yells.
