0_How-To-Use-This-System.txt

This system was built to handle multiple characters without having to have duplicate files/folders for each character.
It also was built to avoid having macro files that were thousands of lines long.

There are three parts to this system.

1. The character file.
2. The default file.
3. The various macro files.

The character file is where you type in the names of your character specific items into specific variables.
The default file loads the various macro files.

The various macro files use the variables defined in your character file to equip, use, role play, and perform other actions.
The various macro files are purpose specific. 
	For instance all the sunstone actions are in the sunstone.macro file. You customize which type of think stone you use in your character file.
	All the healing functions are in the moonstone_functions.macro. You customize your healing tools in your character file.
	
To get an idea about these various files, read the // comments in default to the right of the included file.

A character template file is uploaded in conjunction with this so you can copy and paste into your file if you adopt this system.
Look for 1_character-file_blank.txt
