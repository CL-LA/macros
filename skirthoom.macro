// So here is the latest draught of "This Thoom for Hire".
// Maybe I should have included a plot summary last time so I could show where I was headed.
// I will this time. There are only two more scenes to go at the end of the current script.
// Firstly, Skirwan tells such incredibly bad puns that Fat Alice is disabled and she escapes.
// At the play's climax Skirwan confronts Super Chicken at the top of his gold statue
// and they fight or marry or whatever we end up doing to end the play.
//
// Notes - see them at the end!
//
// I should point out that it's *girl* Skirwan not the zo one
//
// Macro assignments - put / in front of these:
// s# = Skirwan -> Miug as a thoom female
// F# = Fat Alice -> Punny as an old maid
// mujin# = Mujin -> Measle as a human female in mini outfit
// C# = Super Chicken -> Inu in undisclosed pink male cloak outfit - played manically.
// SC# = Santa Chicken -> Measle as a red dwarf

// Prologue: Darkness, Narration, spotlight with darkness in the background: narrative, spotlight on Skirwan the Thoomess Mystic

// NOTES:
// 200804xx-Miug?: I'd like to combine some of those one-liner exchanges, and we need to settle the pauses for each character.  
// 200804xx-Inu: I disagree.  I need to keep my lines separated so I can react and adapt to lag. 
//       I have a lot of trouble with lag.  Sometimes it is very slow, on the order of 10 seconds,
//       other times it is about 1-4 seconds of lag.
// 200804xx-Miug: Hi Measle!  I wanted to add a line for Super Chicken, as I remember from Bawkmas that he claims he doesn't believe in Santa Chicken.
// 200804xx-Inu: Please do not alter my triggers or cue messages. 
//       I can't preload the upcoming trigger
//        as it interferes with calling dances and other Super Chicken motions.
//       I tend to up arrow to recover the last trigger then edit it.
// 200804xx-Miug: All right, I won't put preloading in on yours--those are the Super Chicken lines? 
// 200804xx-Inu: Yes the ones with /C# are mine, thanks!
// 20080414-inu: I fixed the odd characters that show up when the script is copied and pasted into a text document.

// 200804??-Miug--I altered your cue in C9 to show that you should enter after one line, but not speak until another.  
// 20080430-inu fixed my walking stuff to cue me to run instead.  Working on C9 entry to send cue after 20 second pause.
//                     Also added my curtain call.
//              - Also BTW I think I fixed my enormous lag issues, submitted trouble report to Eldon & co.  I have a workaround.
// 20080501-inu: Fixed duplicate /s24 macro calls, made second one into /s25 which was skipped.
// 20080502-inu: Fixed case on s1 - s18 macro calls.  They were uppercase, while miug uses lowercase. I made them lowercase to match
//                     how they are preloaded.  Need to find out if Pun uses uppercase F or lowercase f for her calls.  If lowercase
//                     then I need to fix it in this script. 
//                     BTW.  Should I assume I am the only one who uses uppercase for macro calls in the future? 
//20080502-Stars: Here are some scene descriptors for the backdrops, with scene numbers.  Inserted the descriptors and divided up the script into it's individual scenes.
// Finished!        Prologue: Darkness, Narration, spotlight with darkness in the background: narrative, spotlight on Skirwan the Thoomess Mystic
//                    Drop Scene 1: Fat Alice's cellar and workshop, dark, dirty, creepy things in jars, cobwebs.
//                    Drop Scene 2: Kismia's Island Forest, deep dark woods, eyes in the darkness.
//                    Drop Scene 3: Ruined home with lots of weeds in the fairgrounds, deep shadows. old wood, weeds.
//  Finished!      Drop Scene 4: Drop black backdrop for transition, "It's been a gas."
//                    Drop Scene 5: Top of Chicken Statue: facing east, coast and other islands visible, overcast, misty over treetops 40' elevation.
//                    Drop Scene 6: Top of Chicken Statue: the sun breaks, sunbeam, overcast tone gone.  Facing far to the west, distant islands.
// 20080503-Inu: Removed extra line breaks in middle of character line macros.  Left line breaks where scene changes
//                      were indicated within character lines and outside of character lines.  Hope this doesn't mess anyone up!
//                     I was concerned about the size of this macro file when finished.
// 20080507 Stars WIP: http://www.falchion-gpx.com/sunset.gif This is for Scene 6:
//                      Skirwan should walk up to the lower right of the scene as she looks into the distant sunset.
